  SETUP (Short)
  -------------
  1.  Run the SETUP.pl script ('./SETUP.pl')
  2.  Add the Mirage directory to the PATH
  3.  Check setup by running './mirage --check'



  SETUP (Detailed)
  ----------------
  To setup the mirage software package, first run the SETUP.pl script as follows:

      $ perl SETUP.pl

  Once the setup script has reported successful completion, it is necessary to
  add the program 'spaln' to the PATH environment variable.  This can be done by 
  first running the command "pwd" to see the present working directory.  It 
  should look like this:

      $ pwd
      /Users/yourname/a/file/path/mirage

  Once you have the current directory, you can add it to your PATH variable.
  In BASH, you can add this line to the file ~/.bashrc:

      export PATH=(pwd_results):$PATH

  Refresh your path variable by setting the file that you edited as your source.
  Depending on whether PATH is set in .bash_profile or .bashrc, this will be done 
  with one of the following two commands:

      $ source ~/.bash_profile
            - OR -
      $ source ~/.bashrc

  To test whether everything is setup, you can run the following command from the
  directory containing mirage:

      $ mirage --check

  If setup was successful, this command will report success.  Otherwise, it will
  inform you of what is missing.



  BASIC USAGE
  -----------
  Mirage requires 2 arguments:  a FASTA-formatted protein database and a simple
  guide file directing the program to genomes and gtf indicies for each species
  being searched on.

      $ perl mirage.pl  <Protein DB>  <Species Guide>

  It is expected that the names of the sequences in the protein database will
  begin with 'GN:' and will be followed by the following fields, in order and
  separated by bar (|) characters:

       1. Gene family  
       2. Isoform name 
       3. Species
       4. Isoform identifier / extra '|'-separated fields
       5. Group name

       For example: '>GN:OBSCN|obscn_iso2|human|4L3XR0X|obscn'

  The guide file is a simple text file where each line corresponds to a species
  and has the following fields (separated by whitespace):

       1. Species name, as spelled in the species fields of the protein database
       2. Path to genome, from the directory containing mirage.pl
       3. Path to gtf index file, from the directory containing mirage.pl

       For example: 'human  ../genomes/Human.DNA.fa  ../indices/human.gtf'

  For more information, use 'mirage --help'.



  MORE USAGE
  ----------
  To run mirage on a reduced dataset (such as one particular gene family), first
  create a database containing only the sequences that you are interested in
  searching for.  This can be done with the tools "grep" and "esl-sfetch."
  grep will pull out all lines from a file matching some string pattern, and may
  thus be used to identify all sequence names matching a given format.  For
  example, the command

       grep "GN:OBSCN" big_database.fa

  will list all members of the OBSCN gene family in the file "big_database.fa."
  Because these lines reveal the names of sequences, esl-sfetch can be used to
  pull out the corresponding sequences one at a time.  For example, if the above
  grep command matches '>GN:OBSCN|obscn_iso2|human|4L3XR0X,' then the command

       esl-sfetch big_database.fa "GN:OBSCN|obscn_iso2|human|4L3XR0X|obscn" >> new_database.fa

  will pull out the sequence named "GN:OBSCN|obscn_iso2|human|4L3XR0X|obscn" and
  append it to a file named "new_database.fa" (if there isn't a file with this
  name a new file will be created automatically).

  Once the new database has been generated, re-running mirage is as easy as
  substituting the name of the old database with the name of the new database.

  NOTE: Automation of aligning a data subset is in imminent development plans



  ABOUT
  -----
  Mirage is a tool for generating exon-aware multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) 
  of protein isoforms within the same gene family and across species.  This is
  accomplished through 3 major phases: protein-to-genome alignment, intra-species
  protein alignment, and cross-species alignment of MSAs.

  During the first phase (protein-to-genome alignment), each protein in the database
  is searched against its species' genome, identifying all "hits" (places where some
  section of the protein is identical to one of its purported exons).  The program
  analyzes each protein's hit set and identifies an optimal way of "stitching" the
  hits together to achieve full coverage of the protein.  This is the work done
  by the 'Quilter.pl' script, which relies on 'FastDiagonals' and SPALN (if installed)
  to determine the individual hits.  A side program ('TransSW') is used to measure
  the repetitiveness of the proteins, and may be used to help identify sequencing
  errors.

  The second phase consists of isolating each set of "stitched" hits for each 
  isoform within the same species and gene family and joining these hits together
  to form an intra-species multiple-sequence alignment.  Because the hits can be
  compared to one another by way of their positions in the genome, this alignment
  preserves the exon boundaries indicated by the hits identified in phase 1 and
  places special markers in the MSAs to mark where splice sites are observed.
  This work is done with the 'MultiMSA.pl' script.

  The third phase aligns the MSAs generated during the second phase across species
  (staying within gene families).  This is done with profile-to-profile alignment
  using an slightly modified version of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, using the
  'MultiSeqNW' program.
