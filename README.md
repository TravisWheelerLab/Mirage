# Mirage
Multiple-sequence IsofoRm Alignment tool Guided by Exon boundaries

We use a "git flow" workflow. We have two active branches:
 * **master** will be the stable Mirage release branch. 
 * **develop** is the Mirage development branch


To clone your own copy of Mirage source code repository for the first time:

```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/Mirage
   $ cd Mirage
   $ git checkout develop
```

To contribute to Mirage development, you want to be on the
**develop** branch, which is where we are currently integrating
feature branches. For more information, see the
[Mirage wiki](https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/Mirage/wiki).
